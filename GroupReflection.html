      <h3>Individual Reflections</h3>
      <h4>Luke Davis</h4>
      <p>
        In contrast to the prior assignment, communication frequency and overall group cohesion has been a little poor. Our attendance, both in person and over MS Teams,
        has been the poorest I’ve seen since the beginning of Assignment 2.
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite this, I feel that our writing skills have been improved, and that the burden of the project write-up has shifted to more of the group, which I would regard as
        a positive. I also feel that each of us has stepped into roles where we can offer our best work, which contrasts against the strategy employed in the last assignment
        where we acted more as generalists as opposed to the current, more specialised roles adopted. One such example of this has been the website. Where last time there was
        a significant amount of work done on the website by Kevin, Dylan and I, we have seen Kevin handle much of the website work this time around.
      </p>

      <h4>Rohan Ganger</h4>
      <p>
        Throughout the assessment timeline I felt that I Was more organized than last assessment, However I still had struggled with the underlying issue of procrastinating and not
        utilizing my time, in the most productive manner possible. With once I had overcome that issue in the later weeks, I found what worked well was effective planning such as breaking
        down a large goal into smaller goals and progressively working towards the result, which I Also found that the group was largely able to execute perfectly within their own goals.
        One thing I Found surprising was the learning curve required to design a prototype. Although I had learnt a few skills for designing prototypes in my other class. When it came to a
        more realistic and self-guided design, I had to think more outside the box on how to create a usable design. Which had caused some roadblocks in the path although it had turned out
        fine in the end.  A thing I have learned about groups is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and different responsibleness when it comes to their own life. Which you
        must understand regardless of the situation at the end of the day, the group can still work together to produce an excellent outcome. One thing that I could have improved on personally
        is although I had focused on other sections of the assignment. When it came to the group website, I didn’t make any edit’s simply since I was not willing to learn how the GitHub stuff
        worked. Which is not good enough because other people had to push themselves to learn it no matter what their personal opinions were of the site.
      </p>

      <h4>Kevin Lam</h4>
      <p>
        Throughout the timeline for assignment 3, our group performed poorly. Attendance, whether in class or team meetings were below par. Subsequent to assignment 2, we had half of our group
        members inactive. Although it should be noted that Charle has participated to some degree, it was minimal. Dylan was inactive in team meetings but participated more in class and assisted
        Rohan was the development of prototypes. An immense hurdle was the absence of the author of our project idea, Jai Wells, which to be fair, had fallen tremendously ill.
        <br>
        <br>
        In a similar fashion to assignment 2, Luke took the lead in managing and delegating workload. Rohan, Luke and I completed our assigned tasks however, it should be noted that we each had
        to pick up more pieces in order to complete this assignment.
      </p>

      <h4>Jai Wells</h4>
      <p>
        I felt the organisation of our work and our efforts to work collaboratively on documents has improved since assignment 2. The layout of our shared documents made working on documents at
        the same time far easier than before, sections were clearly marked for each section of the document, and we had separate documents segmenting larger sections of the project. Despite this
        planning, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, our group communication was far worse than during assignment 2. Our group often missed scheduled meeting times over MS Teams
        and many times people were absent from our in-person classes for one reason or another (myself included). I believe this lack of communication has been detrimental to our group’s performance.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was pleasantly surprised that group members found their strengths such as Kevin managing the website side of the assignment and Rohan overseeing the prototype. I feel these specialisations
        allowed the other members of the group to act more as generalists without the group as a whole feeling aimless. I learned (or perhaps reinforced for myself) that when working in a group you
        can’t put off telling them things. I was sick for the last week of the assignment and really should have communicated that with my team and tried my best to help where I still could, despite
        my illness, instead of postponing my work until the last minute as this made some extra hurdles for my groupmates.
      </p>

      <h4>Charle Yang</h4>
      <p>
        Unlike assignment 2 I was able to participate more and help with the assignment. Although I believe I could have done more for the project, I have improved a lot more than before in participation
        and communication with my fellow members. Due to some problems, I’ve missed out on a lot of the meetings, both online and in person, but I was still able to catch up to my members and help as best
        as I can. For the assignment I focused mainly on the ‘detailed descriptions’ filling out the different sections as best as I could, not only creating the document but also outlining what was needed
        and fleshing it out as best as I can. When I couldn’t fill out some parts, I would ask some of the members to help fill it out and expand on it if they have the time. Overall a huge improvement from
        the last assignment and a belief that I could have done more work if I managed my time more carefully.
        <br>
        <br>
        The group overall from my perspective had its ups and downs but did well with organization and progression. Only problem would be the frequency of every teammate being in a meeting is abysmal and could do more work.

        <h3>Group Reflection</h3>
        <em>What went well:</em>
        <p>
          The overall quality of work completed in this assignment has felt solid. Each of the group members appears to be working well to their strengths and contributing what they can.
        </p>

        <br>

        <em>What could be improved:</em>
        <p>
          Communication in this assignment was sorely lacking. As such, the cohesion of the group seems to have dissipated. One frustration that has stemmed from this is the fact that a large portion of the assignment is being
          completed on the weekend it’s due – we have yet to learn our lesson from the previous assignment.
        </p>

        <br>

        <em>Something surprising:</em>
        <p>
          Charlie’s return to the group was quite a surprise. Even so, he has contributed significantly more to the assignment than previously, and appears committed to the group. His communication has been far clearer.
        </p>

        <br>

        <em>Something learned about groups:</em>
        <p>
          Groups need to be bound by more than mere circumstance. In the first assignment, we banded together in order to achieve a fair grade. Sadly, this sentiment appears to have slipped over the course of Assignment 3,
          and has left us working on the assignment simply to get it done. Groups also appear to work well when the members keep each other accountable in a healthy manner. A sense of duty to the collective efforts of the group
          seems to make motivation within the group easier also.
