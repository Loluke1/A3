        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          In assignment 2, we collectively determined that Jai Well’s project idea would be the most suitable for our group. It is a mobile based application that
          allows users to track their medication intake and mood. Why would this be useful? Well, this allows the user to determine what and how medications affect
          their mood. This is especially handy for those who take strong mind-altering drugs or medications that have severe psychedelic effects. 1 in 8 Australians
          are on anti-depressants, and those Aussies are meant to track the effects of those medications between appointments with their doctor. With the use of our
          medication tracking app, users are given a simpler way to do this.
          <br>
          <br>
          The application will allow users to input when they take their medication and receive reminders to do so. Users are also able to input their mood on a schedule
          they define e.g., daily, every other day, certain days, once a week). By keeping a record of the individual’s mood, they and their doctor are able compare the
          medication and mood data.
          <br>
          <br>
          An example is when a user has been on anti-depressants such as Zoloft, for over 6 months and their mood is starting to deteriorate. Common side effects are sleepiness,
          drowsiness and even insomnia. More specifically, users on a medication such a Zoloft can experience emotional blunting or even start to experience suicidal feelings.
          By keeping track of their dosage and mood, their doctor can best determine a method to assist the individual in such a situation.
          <br>
          <br>
          Why did we choose this idea?
          <br>
          <br>
          Our group decided on this idea mainly because of the positivity real-world impact it can have. Not only is it simple, easy, and effective, but it offers a new and
          superior method to track medication and mood between appointments.

          <h4>Aim</h4>
          Our project aims to provide an easy way for patients to track how medications affect their mood. Our project will be a mobile based application. The motivation behind this is the current gap in the
          market for such an app. In order to meet this aim, we’ve come up with three core features that the app would possess:
