        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
          In assignment 2, we collectively determined that Jai Well’s project idea would be the most suitable for our group. It is a mobile based application that
          allows users to track their medication intake and mood. Why would this be useful? Well, this allows the user to determine what and how medications affect
          their mood. This is especially handy for those who take strong mind-altering drugs or medications that have severe psychedelic effects. 1 in 8 Australians
          are on anti-depressants, and those Aussies are meant to track the effects of those medications between appointments with their doctor. With the use of our
          medication tracking app, users are given a simpler way to do this.
          <br>
          <br>
          The application will allow users to input when they take their medication and receive reminders to do so. Users are also able to input their mood on a schedule
          they define e.g., daily, every other day, certain days, once a week). By keeping a record of the individual’s mood, they and their doctor are able compare the
          medication and mood data.
          <br>
          <br>
          An example is when a user has been on anti-depressants such as Zoloft, for over 6 months and their mood is starting to deteriorate. Common side effects are sleepiness,
          drowsiness and even insomnia. More specifically, users on a medication such a Zoloft can experience emotional blunting or even start to experience suicidal feelings.
          By keeping track of their dosage and mood, their doctor can best determine a method to assist the individual in such a situation.
          <br>
          <br>
          Why did we choose this idea?
          <br>
          <br>
          Our group decided on this idea mainly because of the positivity real-world impact it can have. Not only is it simple, easy, and effective, but it offers a new and
          superior method to track medication and mood between appointments.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          <h4> Topic </h4>
          Creating an app to track mood and medication is the ultimate goal of the project. By creating this, we aim to empower the user in their health
          journey. To achieve this, the data collected and analysed by the app can be read by the user, or shared with a trusted health professional.
          Through this process, it ought to be possible for the user to optimise their health outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once fully developed, the app would provide a welcoming, clean interface that allows users to quickly and easily complete their mood reporting while
          being reminded of medication times and prompted to journal to add context to their mood data. This data would be displayed to the user in the form of
          graphs and simple statistical conclusions (where relevant). Ultimately, it ought to engage the user in their health journey and yield strong health
          outcomes for them. This leads us into the motivation for the project.

        </p>
        <p>
          <h4> Motivation </h4>
          The motivation behind this project came from one of our group members, Jai. He noticed that there wasn’t a great app that offered reminders for
          taking medications as well as tracking mood data. With these two requirements, we set about creating the conceptual framework for the app.
          Each of us has found the use case for the app to be unique and interesting in its own right. Further, we have each looked at the project and
          seen areas where we can add real value due to our unique backgrounds and areas of expertise. We also see a wide variety of skills being
          developed through the project due to the ‘moving parts’ involved – databases, thorough consideration of UX, data display and analytics, and
          data security. Because of this, future employers would see that we had experience in developing a non-trivial mobile application that benefitted
          the wider community.

        </p>
        <p>
          <h4> Landscape </h4>
          The landscape for an app exactly like this is quite uncharted at this stage. This is likely due to the app being a synthesis of a medication
          reminder app and a mood tracker. In those, broader categories, there are a wide variety of apps already avaliable. In the mood tracker
          category, we see apps such as Daylio<sup>1</sup>, which appears to achieve some similar aims to our app – it contains a journaling feature, a mood
          record and a diary. There are other apps such as Bearable<sup>2</sup>, which tracks mood and symptoms, and offers some data analysis, and Mood Potatoes<sup>3</sup>,
          which offers a mindfulness journal and mood tracker. In the medicaction reminder category, there are several apps which allows the user to
          schedule medication reminders – Medisafe Pill & Med Reminder<sup>4</sup> is one such app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, there appears to be very little that is geared towards the same specific aims of our app. As such, we feel that offering users
          with a well-constructed app to take the place of several disjoint apps would allow more useful insights into the user’s mood and habits be
          understood.

          <h4>Aim</h4>
          Our project aims to provide an easy way for patients to track how medications affect their mood. Our project will be a mobile based application. The motivation behind this is the current gap in the
          market for such an app. In order to meet this aim, we’ve come up with three core features that the app would possess:
