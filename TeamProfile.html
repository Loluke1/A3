            Hi there, I'm Luke and I’m in my final year of study at RMIT. I’m currently completing my Bachelor of Science (Mathematics).
        I chose this program because of the broad range of electives it offered and the career pathways it facilitates. I’ve long held an interest in IT,
        and completed a 12-month traineeship in the field straight out of school – I enjoyed this thoroughly. In my spare time I enjoy playing bass, and
        maintaining my car and garden.</td><td><img src="./images/Luke.jpg" class="pfPic" /></td></tr>

        My name is Kevin, and I am currently 19 years old studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in Melbourne Australia and have lived here ever since.
        I grew up in the Keilor Downs area. When I was younger, I loved playing sports such as basketball and soccer. Granted I was not very good at them, but I still enjoyed the
        sport/culture. I chose to study this course because there are many different pathways I can take. I am also interested in programming, robotics and anything technology related.
        In high school, I studied all the computer related courses such as robotics and information technology. I was always drawn to computers, whether it be me as a kid tinkering with
        my core 2 duo rig or watching tech channels on YouTube. Some of my hobbies include learning new or interesting things, hiking, badminton, watching TV and playing video games.

      <h3>Team Member 3 - Jai Wells</h3>
      <p><table>
        <tr><td>
          I am from here in Victoria and I completed my VCE at McClelland Secondary College in Frankston,
          in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs. While there I studied Software
          Development and IT, Further Maths, Philosophy, English and Legal Studies.
          I also learned some Japanese early in high school and I tried again recently
          using Duolingo, though I don’t remember much anymore. I recently built my
          own storage and home media server (in reality it's essentially an office
          computer with a large 6TB hard drive installed), it runs an Intel i3-9100
          with 4gb of ram and a 256GB SSD boot + caching drive. My server runs the
          Plex Media Server software on Ubuntu Server, allowing me to essentially
          make my own private Netflix like service with only the tv and movies that
          I want to watch, as well as acting as a bulk file storage device.

        <h3>Group Processes:</h3>
        <p>
          Our group performed well in regard to assignment 2. We encountered some hurdles and surprises along the way but managed to successfully overcome them.
          Each member demonstrated a substantial level of understanding of the work required of them, although, there were many instances where meeting deadlines
          were overextended.
        <br>
        <br>
          The main barriers we encountered were poor time management and poor communication between members of the group. Time management was an issue due to members
          having other duties/priorities to attend to. Others had assignments and tests from other subjects, while many had occupational duties. In terms of communication,
          we had instances were many were absent from our weekly discussions.
        <br>
        <br>
          A major drawback was the absence of our 6th team member. We had attempts to contact him but to no avail. This led to other members having to extend their responsibilities
          and workload. That being said, our group did eventually complete the assignment.
        <br>
        <br>
          We have divided responsibilities for assignment 3 like we did in assignment 2. In terms of changes or improvements, there is not much we can do. All members should be aware
          of what is expected from them.
