      <h2>Team Profile</h2>
      <h3>Team name:</h3>
      <p>As you can naturally deduce from our website, our group name is Wallace and the Gromits. It is the same name we used in Assignment 2.
        Each member has uniformly agreed to keep/use “Wallace and the Gromits” as the name of our group.

        <h3>Group Processes:</h3>
        <p>
          Our group performed well regarding assignment 2. Naturally, we encountered some hurdles and surprises along the way but managed to successfully overcome them. Each member
          demonstrated a substantial level of understanding of the work required of them, although, there were many instances where meeting deadlines were overextended.
        <br>
        <br>
          The main barriers we encountered were poor time management and poor communication between members. Time management was an issue due to members having other duties/priorities to attend to.
          Others had assignments and tests from other subjects, whilst also juggling occupational duties. In terms of communication, we had instances were many were absent from our weekly discussions
          and inactive in the Microsoft Teams chat.
        <br>
        <br>
          A major drawback was the absence of our 6th team member. We had attempts to contact him but to no avail. This led to other members having to extend their responsibilities and workload.
          That being said, our group did manage and submit assignment 2 within the deadline.
        <br>
        <br>
          We have divided responsibilities for assignment 3 like we did in assignment 2. In terms of changes or improvements, there is not much we can do. All members should be aware of what is expected from them.

        <h3>Career Plans:</h3>
        <p>
          Here is a table describing and comparing our ideal Jobs.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Ideal jobs.jpg" class="borderforimage" alt="Ideal Occupations List" width="800" height="900">
        <p>
          A common element between our ideal jobs is that each, except full stack web developer, are very similar in terms of job responsibilities. For instance, support technician and IT technician are immensely similar
          in that the person is responsible for maintaining, upgrading, and ensuring that the organisations’ core computer infrastructure is running optimally and efficiently. They also are responsible for assisting employees
          with IT related tasks. Systems administrator does this but to a certain extent. A system administrator oversees the configuration and maintenance, whilst the IT technician or support technician carries out the tasks.
          <br>
          <br>
          If we were to rank the three similar occupations in a pyramid, system administrator would be at the top with IT and support technician following behind. Principal security consultant and full stack web developer are
          similar to the other jobs but only to some degree.
          <br>
          <br>
          Principal security consultants are hired to determine flaws or vulnerabilities in an organisation’s security infrastructure. They ensure that minimum requirements are met for regulatory compliance, whilst identifying
          and proposing areas for improvement.
          <br>
          <br>
          A full stack web developer is more so a programmer hence why it is different compared to our other occupations. Full stack web developers work on both the back and front end of websites. This includes the database as
          well as the whole infrastructure.
