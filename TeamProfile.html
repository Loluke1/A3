      <h3>Team name:</h3>
      <p>As you can naturally deduce from our website, our group name is Wallace and the Gromits. It is the same name we used in Assignment 2.
        Each member has uniformly agreed to keep/use “Wallace and the Gromits” as the name of our group.

        <h3>Group Processes:</h3>
        <p>
          Our group performed well in regard to assignment 2. We encountered some hurdles and surprises along the way but managed to successfully overcome them.
          Each member demonstrated a substantial level of understanding of the work required of them, although, there were many instances where meeting deadlines
          were overextended.
        <br>
        <br>
          The main barriers we encountered were poor time management and poor communication between members of the group. Time management was an issue due to members
          having other duties/priorities to attend to. Others had assignments and tests from other subjects, while many had occupational duties. In terms of communication,
          we had instances were many were absent from our weekly discussions.
        <br>
        <br>
          A major drawback was the absence of our 6th team member. We had attempts to contact him but to no avail. This led to other members having to extend their responsibilities
          and workload. That being said, our group did eventually complete the assignment.
        <br>
        <br>
          We have divided responsibilities for assignment 3 like we did in assignment 2. In terms of changes or improvements, there is not much we can do. All members should be aware
          of what is expected from them.
