      <h3>Group Communication</h3>
      <p>
        With assignment 3, we have decided to stick with the software used for our previous assignment. We are using Microsoft Teams for organising files,
        meetings and communicating to each other. Through the use of Microsoft Teams, we have conducted meetings which are held at least once a week (usually two).
        Independent work that each individual member conducts is also posted in Teams where it can be accessed and edited by all members.
