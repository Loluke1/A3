      <h3>Group Communication</h3>
      <p>
        With assignment 3, we have decided to stick with the software used for our previous assignment. We are using Microsoft Teams for organising files,
        meetings and communicating to each other. Through the use of Microsoft Teams, we have conducted meetings which are held at least once a week (usually two).
        Independent work that each individual member conducts is also posted in Teams where it can be accessed and edited by all members.

      <h3>Github</h3>
      <p>
        Overall, our utilisation of GitHub has been far more surgical and precice than in Assignment 2. The key difference is that we had our foundations
        laid essentially from the start, and only needed to do substantial work on the site as the content became finalised in the final few days (and hours)
        of the assessment. As such, our lines committed looks roughly like this:<br/>
